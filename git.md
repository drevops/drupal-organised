## Branches

* Each story **MUST** live in it's own branch.
* Branch name **SHOULD** be a story number preceded by `feature/` without any additional description
  * Correct: `feature/PRJ-123`
  * Incorrect: `my-feature`, `PRJ-123`, `features/PRJ-123-my-feature`

## Comments

* Each comment **SHOULD** start with an issue number\(s\) inside square braces `[` and `]` followed by a sentence starting with a verb in past tense and properly terminated.
  * Correct:
    * `[PRJ-123] Verb in the past tense ending with a dot at the end.`
    * `[PRJ, PRJ-123] Verb in the past tense ending with a dot at the end.`
    * `[PRJ-321, PRJ-123] Verb in the past tense ending with a dot at the end.`
    * `[PRJ] Verb in the past tense ending with a dot at the end.`
    * `Verb in the past tense ending with a dot at the end.`
    * `Verb in the past tense ending with a dot at the end. Another sentence with a dot.`
  * Incorrect:
    * `Adding a feature`
    * `some stuff`
    * `PRJ-123 Adding a feature`
    * `[prj-123] Adding a feature`
* It is highly advised to use a git `commit-msg` hook to automatically validate the format of commits. Use [https://github.com/AlexSkrypnyk/git-hooks ](https://github.com/AlexSkrypnyk/git-hooks)to install such hook implementation \(a 1-liner command ran from your project git repo\).

## Cleanup

Each developer is expected to cleanup own branches in `remote` repository as soon as they merged to main development branch.

**Remove local branches that were merged into local `develop` branch:**

```text
git branch --merged develop | egrep -v "master|releases|release|hotfix|project|develop|ci" | xargs git branch -d
```

or alias

```text
#
# Remove local branches that were merged into main local branch.
# 
# Compare with default `develop` branch.
# git-cleanup
#
# Compare with custom `master` branch.
# git-cleanup master
#
git-cleanup() {
    main=${1:-develop}
    git branch --merged $main | egrep -v 'master|releases|release|hotfix|project|develop|ci' | xargs git branch -d
}
```

**Remove remote branches from remote `orgin` that were merged:**

```text
git branch -r --merged | egrep -v "master|releases|release|hotfix|project|develop|ci" | sed 's/origin\///'|xargs -n 1 git push --delete origin
```

or alias

```text
#
# Remove remote branches from remote `orgin` that were merged.
#
git-cleanup-remote() {
    git branch -r --merged | egrep -v "master|releases|release|hotfix|project|develop|ci" | sed "s/origin\///" | xargs -n 1 git push --delete origin
}
```
