# Introduction

## Why

1.  As developers, we need better organised Drupal websites, because we should

    not spend days trying to understand what previous developer built and where

    it is all located.
2.  As community members, we want to rely on community experience to make this a

    truly community-driven guide.
3.  As project participants, we need a centralised reference for such

    documentation.
